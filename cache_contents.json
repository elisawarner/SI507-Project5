(No, this is not an anti-Lena Dunham post. Here at Every Single Word we don\u2019t point the fingers at people but at systemic trends and patterns).

It was from an interview Dunham had done on NPR in 2012.\n\n\u201cThis show isn\u2019t supposed to feel exclusionary. It\u2019s supposed to feel honest, and it\u2019s supposed to feel true to many aspects of my experience. But for me to ignore that criticism [about the show\u2019s lack of diversity] and not to take it in would really go against my beliefs and my education in so many things. \u2026 Something I wanted to avoid was tokenism in casting. If I had one of the four girls, if, for example, she was African-American, I feel like \u2014 not that the experience of an African-American girl and a white girl are drastically different, but there has to be specificity to that experience [that] I wasn\u2019t able to speak to.\u201d (Fresh Air, 2012)\n\nClearly Dunham was aware of the show\u2019s criticism and offers a thoughtful response. I re-watched the Girls pilot. And I really enjoyed it. It lovingly and hilariously lampoons privilege, and captures the hope and despair of some people\u2019s early twenties. Also, I was reminded of the strength of Lena Dunham\u2019s writing. And yet, the quote still made me uneasy. In looking to unpack her idea that she didn\u2019t have the authority to write a part for a non-white girl I was so busy looking for things I didn\u2019t like about the pilot, that the real reason the quote didn\u2019t sit with me was just the opposite: I did like the pilot. I, a person of color, identified with her characters.\n\nGirls is about privilege and aimlessness, not about about whiteness. I know many women of color just like the show\u2019s main characters. Women of color who are college educated, financially supported, brilliant, and questioning what fuck they\u2019re going to do with their lives. The notion that Dunham couldn\u2019t capture the \u201cspecificity\u201d of a woman of a different race seems to be operating on the myth that there is a different way to be a person of color. Considering that these characters are written as privileged, not white, it would have been so cool to see a woman of color grapple not with her color but with her privilege.\n\nThe show that kept coming to mind was The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, specifically the Hilary character. She was so refreshing, not because she represented ALL black women but because she represented SOME black women. She was a materialistic valley girl, loveably out-to-lunch, and black. All three of those truths existed simultaneously. The gift of that show, aside from the immortal theme song, is that it complicates what it means to be black. Because being black is not a singular experience. \n\nNaomi Ekperigin, a writer for Broad City and a good friend, recently did a great interview with Marie Claire.

Women of color who are college educated, financially supported, brilliant, and questioning what fuck they&rsquo;re going to do with their lives. The notion that Dunham couldn&rsquo;t capture the &ldquo;specificity&rdquo; of a woman of a different race seems to be operating on the myth that there is a different way to be a person of color. Considering that these characters are written as privileged, not white, it would have been so cool to see a woman of color grapple not with her color but with her privilege.\n\nThe show that kept coming to mind was The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, specifically the Hilary character. She was so refreshing, not because she represented ALL black women but because she represented SOME black women. She was a materialistic valley girl, loveably out-to-lunch, and black. All three of those truths existed simultaneously. The gift of that show, aside from the immortal theme song, is that it complicates what it means to be black. Because being black is not a singular experience. \n\nNaomi Ekperigin, a writer for Broad City and a good friend, recently did a great interview with Marie Claire. She declares that her &ldquo;next great push is for women of color to be allowed to be that flawed, to be potheads, and to be aimless. Aimless is the key word. We have all the women trying to find themselves. But, if you&rsquo;re a black woman on TV, you better be running a damn empire, sleeping with the President, saving people&rsquo;s lives, teaching people law. You have to have a very strong skill.&rdquo; \n\nLet&rsquo;s complicate what it looks like to be a person of color on screen. And yes, that means showing privileged, aimless people of color too.</p>", "is_current_item": true, "is_root_item": true}], "can_like": true, "can_reblog": true, "can_send_in_message": true, "can_reply": true, "display_avatar": true}, {"type": "text", "blog_name": "everysinglewordspoken", "id": 140857175693, "post_url": "https://everysinglewordspoken.tumblr.com/post/140857175693/the-impossibility-necessity-of-queer-men-of", "slug": "the-impossibility-necessity-of-queer-men-of", "date": "2016-03-11 15:07:21 GMT", "timestamp": 1457708841, "state": "published", "format": "html", "reblog_key": "Q8yE1Mwr", "tags": ["michael b jordan", "ryan coogler", "vanity fair", "nate parker", "intersectionality", "dylan marron", "every single word", "every single word spoken by a person of color in", "queer men of color"], "short_url": "https://tmblr.co/ZPdN6k23BlUwD", "summary": "The Impossibility & Necessity of Queer Men of Color on Screen", "is_blocks_post_format": false, "recommended_source": null, "recommended_color": null, "followed": false, "liked": false, "note_count": 1352, "title": "The Impossibility & Necessity of Queer Men of Color on Screen", "body": "Just like you, maybe, I saw the Vanity Fair portrait of Michael B.

Pictures and celebrities are our avatars; they stand for us when we\u2019re not there. They are our proxies in fantasy worlds and historical re-tellings and red carpet photographs. They are meant to be just like us. Maybe.\n\nPeople of color have far fewer avatars on screen than our white counterparts. And with that comes a protectiveness of how our avatars are presented. I read Nate Parker\u2019s promise to never play a gay character and the comments about the \u201cemasculation of the black man\u201d not as hate, but as terrified preciousness. The fear that one of the limited reflections they see of themselves will be devalued and shattered with the slightest wrong move.\n\nNate Parker is not the enemy. Nor are the commenters.

She asks, \u201cWhy can\u2019t a regular person be a ghostbuster. Im confused. And why can\u2019t i be the one who plays them i am a performer.\u201d Part of the fight for representation is making sure that all of us get to be represented on screen, not just some of us. In a recent roundtable for The Hollywood Reporter, Justin Simien said \u201cThere is an obsession with black tragedy. If you see a black movie\u2026 It\u2019s people who are enduring these horrible tragedies, or they\u2019re saintlike\u2026 You know what that says, very subtly? It says that we\u2019re not human. Because human beings are multifaceted.\u201d Yup. He totally nails it. \n\nRepresentation of POC on screen doesn\u2019t just mean making more heroic Selma-like movies or more tragic 12 Years A Slave-like movies (although both were excellent contributions to film), it means making more roles where POCs are just normal, everyday people. The good news is that the Ghostbusters reboot seems to do just that. Leslie Jones plays an MTA worker! A normal, everyday person! So we\u2019re good, right? This film isn\u2019t racist and yay feminism and let\u2019s just shut up and enjoy the movie, right?!\n\nIf your answer was an exasperated \u2018yes!\u2019 to that question you are welcome to stop reading. If you are curious about where that question mark can lead us, let\u2019s do this:\n\nThe problem isn\u2019t that Leslie Jones plays an MTA employee. She is a brilliant performer who got a great role in a huge studio franchise. (Congratulations, Leslie. I can\u2019t wait to see you kill it up there. Also, MTA employees are the unsung heroes of our daily commute.) The problem is that the only Woman of Color in the entire movie plays an MTA employee. Wanna know the three other roles credited to women of color on the movie\u2019s IMDb page? \u201cWoman,\u201d \u201cGhost Prostitute,\u201d and \u201cHiggins College Student.\u201d Leslie is likely the only woman of color who gets to talk on screen. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie reminds us of the dangers of a single story. \u201cThe single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story.\u201d Through no fault of her own, Leslie Jones\u2019 character represents the only story for women of color.\n\nI celebrate a Ghostbusters reboot with women in the lead.
